This code is a strategy I use to auto-trade stocks in the ThinkOrSwim application. It relies on momentum
shifts and Heiken Ashi Candle prices on a daily timeframe to buy and sell with minimal loss.

Testing this strategy on NVidia, within a 3 year timeframe, this algorithm multiplies any investment
made by 11 times its initial value.

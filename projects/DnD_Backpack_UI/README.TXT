This desktop Java application acts as a tabletop item manager, tailored specifically for
D&D formatting. All items are saved and loaded into a text file with delimiters to separate
the data points. No encryption protocols are used.

Upon starting the program, if a user has prior saved data, they should click Load to load their list of items.
Their items list will appear on the left, and upon clicking, the stats of the item will autofill within the
GUI. If an item is to be added, the blanks in the item's descriptors must be filled out, then the Add button
pressed. No item may be edited once added, since items rarely if ever change in their innate properties.
If an item's properties were not inputted correctly, the item may be selected, and its properties will auto-
fill the GUI. From there, a new item may be added, made with the respective changes. Then, selecting the old
item, that item may be removed from the list by pressing the Delete button, allowing for a round-about way
of editing.

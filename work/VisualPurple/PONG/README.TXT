Version 1 of the Pong project was made in 48 hours as a competency test for hiring.
Version 10 of the Pong project was made after approximately a month of work adding UI, gameplay,
and physics elements. Both have AI players and local single-machine multiplayer functionality.

1 PLAYER:
Use the W and S keys to control the player paddle.

2 PLAYER:
Use both the W and S keys to control Player 1's paddle (left), and the Up and Down keys to control
Player 2's paddle (right).

In Version 10, press TAB to open the Developer's menu and alter settings.

Both versions were made using Unreal Engine version 5.1 and Visual Studio Community 2022; however,
Pong v10 was made in preparation to include a custom OpenXR VR plugin. Some errors may be present
due to the nature of the custom plugin's programming (which was not made available to the public).

The Multiplayer Server was made for the company's VR military simulation, made for the American and
British Air Forces, and is unrelated to the Pong project. Due to the nature of the simulation's NDA
with the military hardware involved, the Unreal Engine code could not be included in this repository.


As a precursor, the company (Visual Purple) is a game development company that primarily relied on
the military contract as a source of income. I was hired on to hopefully ease the company's way
into being self-reliant, thus allowing me to build the Pong game in hopes that we could develop
our own content and earn income separate from the military contract. However, the military contract
was cut short, and the company was forced to lay off over a fourth of its staff. I was new to the
team, so I was cut, thus leaving the Pong project and the multiplayer server unfinished.

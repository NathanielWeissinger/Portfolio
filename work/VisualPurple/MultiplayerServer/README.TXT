This server was built to interface with custom Unreal Engine code to support online multiplayer
functionality. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the NDA working with military hardware, the
Unreal Engine code could not be included in the repository.

The server was built using Visual Studio Community 2022. The server in its entirety was almost
complete, but due to the contract cancellation, the server remains unfinished; however, the only
class that primarily needs updating is MasterServer.Core->Models->ServerData.cs.

I was in charge of code review for the master server, documenting its functionality, and ensuring
all parts were accounted for and working correctly. All comments and formatting within the
solution were outlined by me.

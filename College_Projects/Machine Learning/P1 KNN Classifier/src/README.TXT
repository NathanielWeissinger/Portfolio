This program does three things:
-Reads training data from a text file and saves the text into a string array
-Parses the data by transposing the array and separating the training data by letters
-Calculates the RMS of all the data

When running this program, the output shows the RMS values for each mu (in order by which they're defined in
traindat.txt, going from the leftmost column to right in the first row).
Outputs of each method can be seen by uncommenting the System.out.println lines within each method, wherein
most of them will display both the data as well as the row and column that the data is saved into within
the particular array.
